# Advanced Performance Optimization for KidsAsk-V1

This document describes advanced techniques for optimizing the KidsAsk-V1 application's performance to achieve response times under 10ms.

## Latest Optimizations

### 1. Improved Caching Strategy

- **LRU Cache Implementation**: Replaced the simple dictionary cache with a proper LRU (Least Recently Used) cache that intelligently manages memory by removing the least recently used entries when capacity is reached.
- **Cache Statistics**: Added cache hit rate monitoring to track cache efficiency.
- **Normalized Cache Keys**: Improved cache key generation by normalizing input text, increasing cache hit rates.

### 2. Advanced Model Warmup

- **Comprehensive Warmup**: Created an advanced warmup script that primes the model with diverse questions across all topics.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Fine-tuned model parameters like `num_batch`, `num_thread`, and added `mirostat` parameters for more stable generation.
- **Varied Prompt Types**: Included a range of question complexities in the warmup to prepare the model for different input patterns.

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- **Response Time Tracking**: Added millisecond-precision timing for all model responses.
- **Health Metrics Endpoint**: Enhanced the health check endpoint to expose performance statistics.
- **Monitoring Script**: Created a dedicated performance monitoring script to test and track response times.

## Advanced Tuning Options

For environments requiring extremely low latency (sub-10ms response times), consider these additional optimizations:

### Model Quantization

Ollama supports various quantization levels that significantly reduce memory usage and computation time:

```bash
# Pull a more heavily quantized model variant
docker exec -it kidsask-v1_ollama_1 ollama pull gemma:2b-q4_0
```

Update the model configuration to use this quantized version:

```json
{
  "model_config": {
    "default_model": "gemma:2b-q4_0",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Kernel-Level Optimizations

For Linux hosts, consider these system-level optimizations:

1. **CPU Pinning**: Pin the Ollama process to specific CPU cores
2. **I/O Scheduler**: Set the I/O scheduler to 'deadline' for lower latency
3. **Memory Optimization**: Adjust swappiness and cache settings

### Response Streaming

For perceived performance improvements, implement streaming responses so that partial results appear while the model is still generating:

```javascript
// In the frontend client
const streamResponse = async (message) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/chat/stream', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message, topicId: selectedTopic })
  });
  
  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  let partialResponse = '';
  
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    
    const chunk = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
    partialResponse += chunk;
    updateUIWithPartialResponse(partialResponse);
  }
};
```

## Benchmarking and Validation

To validate optimizations, use the new monitoring script:

```bash
./monitor-performance.sh
```

This will test response times across different topics and measure cache efficiency. Target metrics:

- First response: < 100ms
- Cached response: < 10ms
- Cache hit rate: > 80% in production

## Troubleshooting

If performance remains below expectations:

1. Check CPU/RAM usage during inference with `docker stats`
2. Review logs for any warnings about model parameters
3. Consider a more powerful host machine for the Ollama container
4. Reduce model size further (e.g., try `gemma:2b-q2_K`)
