I want to develop a website called kidsask.ai that is complatable with any web browser on pc & mac including ios and android.

The servers running the site must be running in docker containers
each server will have its own container with docker network comunication between each container on my mac as dev env in the folder called KIDSASK-V1 i created a new git reository for this

The site must be based on an AI bot that answers kids qustions in spcific topics only, and doesnt allow any uniaproprite chat and talk that isnt fit for kids.
the topics the kids can ask about are
1. Animals
2. Space and Planets
3. The Human Body
4. Dinosaurs
5. Weather and Natural Phenomena
6. teams sprots and single play sports
7. Technology and Robots
8. The Ocean
